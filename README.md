### Computer Science · John Abbott College

I love combining precise, well-structured code with soft, thoughtful design.  
This space is where my projects, experiments, and ideas come together.

## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at John Abbott College in my 3rd year with a strong interest in building clear, well-organized applications that feel good to use.

I enjoy **math** and **statistics**, and I naturally gravitate toward work that requires precision, structure, and attention to detail.  
At the same time, I care deeply about **design**, layouts, colors, and how everything fits together.

In my projects, I try to balance both sides:  
a strong logical foundation underneath and a soft, clean interface on top.
